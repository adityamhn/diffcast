# Diffcast
## Automated Feature Demos from Code Changes

## The Problem

When developers ship new features, non-technical stakeholders are left in the dark. Product managers read commit messages they don't understand. Marketing teams wait days for demo videos. Customer success can't explain what changed. The result? Miscommunication, delayed launches, and features that go unnoticed.

**The gap:** Code changes happen in seconds. Explaining them to humans takes hours.

## Our Solution

Diffcast automatically transforms every merged PR into a narrated demo video — no human intervention required.

When your team merges code, Diffcast:

- Analyzes the git diff using Gemini 3 to understand what changed
- Runs your tool and records the walkthrough of the new feature
- Produces a demo video with voiceover and captions
- Exports in multiple languages so global teams stay aligned
- Delivers instantly to your team's dashboard

**Result:** Your entire organization understands new features the moment they ship.
